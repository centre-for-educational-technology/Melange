# Melange
Melange project

Made with Unity ver 5.6.0f3


# Installation
1. Clone this repo or download it as a zip file and unpack
2. Download the `Resources` folder from here (since it's too big to host on Github) and place it inside the `/Assets` folder (so it would become `/Assets/Resources`)
3. Buy the [Dialogue System for Unity plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/dialogue-system-for-unity-11672) (or get it from Martin) and add it in the `/Assets` folder
4. Start Unity and wait for it to re-import everything
